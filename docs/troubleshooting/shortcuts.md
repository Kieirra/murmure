# Shortcut Issues

## Shortcut Doesn't Work

### On macOS

**Check permissions**: Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and verify that Murmure is enabled in both **Accessibility** and **Input Monitoring**.

**After upgrading from 1.6.0**: You must completely reset permissions. See the [macOS installation guide](../getting-started/macos.md#upgrading-from-160) for the exact steps.

**System shortcut conflict**: `Ctrl+Space` is used by macOS for switching input sources. Change your Murmure shortcut to something else (e.g., `Ctrl+Option+M`, `F2`).

**"Failed to save shortcut"**: Another application is already using that shortcut. Try a different combination.

### On Linux (Wayland)

Global shortcuts do not work under Wayland. The recording shortcut only works when the Murmure window is focused.

**Fix**: Switch to an X11 session. On the login screen, select "GNOME on Xorg" or "Plasma (X11)".

Wayland support for GNOME 48+ distributions is planned for version 1.9.0.

### On Linux (X11)

If the shortcut doesn't respond at all:

1. Make sure no other application has claimed the same global shortcut
2. Try a different shortcut
3. Check the logs (Settings > System > Debug mode > folder icon)

### On Windows

If the shortcut doesn't work:

1. Check if another application is using the same shortcut
2. Check if your antivirus (especially Kaspersky) is blocking the global shortcut listener
3. Try running Murmure as administrator (temporary test only)

## Shortcut Toggles Rapidly (Linux)

On Ubuntu 24.04 Wayland, holding the shortcut may toggle recording on/off very quickly (~3Hz) instead of holding steady.

**Cause**: Wayland shortcut handling sends repeated key events.

**Fix**: Switch to X11 session. This will be fixed in version 1.9.0.

## F13-F24 Keys Not Recognized

Support for extended function keys (F13-F24), keypad keys, and OEM keys was added in version **1.8.0**. Update Murmure if you're on an older version.

These keys are useful for Stream Deck and custom keyboard users.

## Mouse Buttons

Mouse button shortcuts are supported since v1.8.0. This can be a good alternative to keyboard shortcuts, especially on macOS where keyboard shortcuts have more quirks.

## Recommended Shortcuts by OS

| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Windows**         | `Ctrl+Space`, `Ctrl+Alt+M`, `F2`          | AltGr combos (AltGr = Ctrl+Alt) |
| **macOS**           | `Ctrl+Option+M`, `F2`, `F3`, mouse button | Space, numbers, letters         |
| **Linux (X11)**     | `Ctrl+Space`, `F2`, `Ctrl+Alt+M`          | -                               |
| **Linux (Wayland)** | N/A (not yet supported)                   | -                               |
