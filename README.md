# Murmure

A privacy-first, open-source speech-to-text application that runs entirely on your machine, powered by a neural network via NVIDIA‚Äôs Parakeet model for fast, local transcription. Murmure turns your voice into text with no internet connection and zero data collection, and supports 25 European languages.

## Features

- **Privacy First**: All processing happens locally on your device. No data ever leaves your computer.
- **No Telemetry**: Zero tracking, zero analytics. Your data stays yours, always.
- **Open Source**: Free and open source software. Inspect, modify, and contribute.
- **Powered by Parakeet**: NVIDIA‚Äôs state-of-the-art speech recognition model runs entirely on-device for fast, low-latency transcription.

## Supported Languages:

Bulgarian (bg), Croatian (hr), Czech (cs), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English (en), Estonian (et), Finnish (fi), French (fr), German (de), Greek (el), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Latvian (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Maltese (mt), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Romanian (ro), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es), Swedish (sv), Russian (ru), Ukrainian (uk)

## Installation

### Windows

The Windows build is self-signed, as I'm not paying certification authorities just to remove the SmartScreen warning. Because of that, Windows may show a security message when you install it. The installer is safe, it will simply build its reputation over time as more users run it, and the warning will gradually disappear.

1. Download murmure_{version}_x64_en-US.msi from the [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.

### Linux

‚ö†Ô∏è Murmure doesn‚Äôt work well on Wayland-based distributions (except Fedora, which has no issues). It seems to be a problem related to the Tauri framework I used, and being on X11 doesn‚Äôt make it easy for me to fix the issue.

1. Download murmure_{version}_amd64.AppImage from [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x murmure-x86_64.AppImage`
3. Run the AppImage.

Murmure uses the [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page) API to
access your microphone, so if you're running Pipewire for your audio stack,
make sure that the ALSA API calls are routed through it (e.g. by installing
[the `pipewire-alsa`
package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pipewire-alsa/) on Arch
Linux), otherwise you'll have errors such as `ALSA lib
pcm_dsnoop.c:567:(snd_pcm_dsnoop_open) unable to open slave`.

#### Arch Linux

On Arch Linux, you can install [the `murmure` package directly from the
AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/murmure) using your favorite helper:

```sh
aura -A murmure
# Or
yay -S murmure
# Or
paru -S murmure
```

## Usage

Murmure provides a clean and focused speech-to-text experience.
Once launched, simply start recording your voice. The text appears instantly, processed directly on your computer.

Typical use cases include:

- Dictating to any AI prompt (Cursor, ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.)
- Writing notes hands-free
- Capturing creative ideas or dictation

Because all computation is local, no network connection is required.

## Technology

Murmure uses NVIDIA‚Äôs Parakeet TDT, a highly optimized, experimental transformer-based speech recognition model designed for low-latency, on-device inference. It combines fast transcription with strong accuracy across multiple languages, running efficiently on consumer GPUs or CPUs.
