# Murmure

A privacy-first, open-source speech-to-text application that runs entirely on your machine, powered by a neural network via NVIDIA’s Parakeet model for fast, local transcription. Murmure turns your voice into text with no internet connection and zero data collection, and supports 25 European languages.

## Installation

### Windows (Official)

⚠️ Windows SmartScreen : This installer is **not signed with a commercial certificate** (which costs ~€200–€500/year).  
If you downloaded it from our **official GitHub releases**, you can safely continue.

🛡️ We guarantee the installer is safe, contains **no malware**, and you can verify the source code or even compile it yourself if you prefer.

1. Download Murmure_x64.msi from the [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.

### Linux (Official)

⚠️ Murmure currently has limited support on Wayland-based distributions (except Fedora, which can fall back to X11 for some apps).  
This appears to be related to Wayland’s sandbox restrictions for AppImages, the global shortcut to start recording will not work in this environment.  
No workaround is available yet. See #28

1. Download Murmure_amd64.AppImage from [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x Murmure_amd64.AppImage`
3. Run the AppImage.

Murmure uses the [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page) API to
access your microphone, so if you're running Pipewire for your audio stack,
make sure that the ALSA API calls are routed through it (e.g. by installing
[the `pipewire-alsa`
package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pipewire-alsa/) on Arch
Linux), otherwise you'll have errors such as `ALSA lib
pcm_dsnoop.c:567:(snd_pcm_dsnoop_open) unable to open slave`.

### MacOS (Official)

⚠️ MacOS may show security warnings because Murmure **isn’t signed with a paid Apple certificate**. These warnings are expected for independent apps, and Murmure is safe to install.

🛡️ We guarantee the installer is safe, contains **no malware**, and you can verify the source code or even compile it yourself if you prefer.

1. Download Murmure_aarch64_darwin.dmg from the [release](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure/releases) page
2. Open the DMG. If macOS blocks it, go to System Settings → Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway".
3. Drag Murmure to the Applications folder, then open it from there.
4. If you see an "app is damaged" message, click Cancel, run `xattr -cr /Applications/Murmure.app` in Terminal, then reopen Murmure.

#### Arch Linux (Community)

⚠️ Community builds are maintained by kind contributors on a best-effort basis.
They do their best to keep them up to date, but there’s no guarantee they will always be.
If you encounter a bug with one of these packages, please open an issue in the corresponding community repository instead.

Community repository: https://github.com/Horgix/aur-package_murmure_mirror

On Arch Linux, you can install [the `murmure` package directly from the
AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/murmure) using your favorite helper:

```sh
aura -A murmure
# Or
yay -S murmure
# Or
paru -S murmure
```

## Usage

Murmure provides a clean and focused speech-to-text experience.
Once launched, simply start recording your voice. The text appears instantly, processed directly on your computer.

Typical use cases include:

- Dictating to any AI prompt (Cursor, ChatGPT, Mistral, etc.)
- Writing notes hands-free
- Capturing creative ideas or dictation

Because all computation is local, no network connection is required.

## Technology

Murmure uses NVIDIA’s Parakeet TDT, a highly optimized, experimental transformer-based speech recognition model designed for low-latency, on-device inference. It combines fast transcription with strong accuracy across multiple languages, running efficiently on consumer GPUs or CPUs.

## Changelog
